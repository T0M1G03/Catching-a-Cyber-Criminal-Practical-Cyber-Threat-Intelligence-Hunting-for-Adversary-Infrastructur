# Catching-a-Cyber-Criminal-Practical-Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-Hunting-for-Adversary-Infrastructur
Adversary Pursuit is a novel Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) strategy that uses distinctive internet footprints to catch Cyber Criminals and monitor infrastructure before they intrude on your network. The purpose of this study is to prove that Adversary Infrastructure can be identified and tracked. Adversary Pursuit phases are compared to research papers to show how it could be implemented with Enriched Threat Intelligence Platforms (ETIPs) and how an academic tool that can improve MITRE ATT&amp;CK Mapping on Cyber Threat Reports (CTRs). The main problem is automation. The research observes, identifies, monitors and tracks, with automation, 4 individual Cyber Threats that organisations might face. All of the findings offered actionable intelligence that organisations may employ right away to defend themselves. This is a significant report on how to track cyber threats that are persistent and sophisticated, adjectives that describe todayâ€™s cyber threat landscape.
